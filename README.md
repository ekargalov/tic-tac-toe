# tic-tac-toe

## Building from scratch
TBD


## Work plan
1. Implement a tic-tak-toe prototype
2. Refactor into different files with corresponding names
3. [Make a m,n,k-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game)
4. Reimplement `Player`, `Field` and etc to be inherited from some base e.g. `BasicPlayer`
5. Start doing unit tests
6. Create one more game using previously created `Basic`s, e.g. battleship
7. Add CI/CD ???

## Follow-up questions
1. [Header guards](https://dzen.ru/a/YCkMS7SYcFqBc6yY)
2. Raw pointer (new, delete, nullptr)
3. References
4. Basic object concepts and purposes
* class, struct 
* constructor, destructor
* constructor initializer list
* fields
* methods (member functions)
* sections (public, private)
