# tic-tac-toe

## Building from scratch
TBD


## Work plan
1. Implement a tic-tak-toe prototype
2. Refactor into different files with corresponding names
3. Reimplement `Player`, `Field` and etc to be inherited from some base e.g. `BasicPlayer`
4. Start doing unit tests
5. Create one more game using previously created `Basic`s, e.g. battleship
6. Add CI/CD ???

## Follow-up questions
1. Header guards
2. Raw pointer (new, delete, nullptr)
3. References
4. Basic object concepts and purposes
* class, struct 
* constructor, destructor
* constructor initializer list
* fields
* methods (member functions)
* sections (public, private)
